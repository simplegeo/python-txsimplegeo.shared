python-txsimplegeo.shared (0.9.0) lucid; urgency=low

  [ Zooko Ofsimplegeo ]
  * an initial version of txsimplegeo.shared which passes all tests but
    doesn't yet have tests of using oauth or any real-world manual
    testing
  * add debian/rules (copied from the txoauth project)
  * update metadata including build-time dependencies
  * version file formatted so hudson can update the build-number stamp
    without conflicting with the manually-controlled version-number
    stamp
  * parse the new split version number (manual version number and
    automatic build number)
  * see if python-setuptools-trial is spelled this way
  * stop trying to use setuptools_trial, just use trial
  * how to run trial under coverage
  * perhaps the version of coverage available on the hudson slave
    doesn't support --branch
  * ah, we need the python-twisted-bin debian package to get trial
  * hm... how about if I spell "run trial under coverage" this way...
  * I think python-coverage gets confused by the PYTHONPATH somehow...
